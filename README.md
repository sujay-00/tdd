This repository contains the implementation of the String Calculator Kata using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The kata is designed to help developers practice TDD by incrementally building a simple string calculator.

Features:
Add numbers from a string of comma-separated values.
Handle newlines as valid separators in addition to commas.
Support custom delimiters defined in the string.
Handle empty strings gracefully.
Throw an exception for negative numbers and list all negatives in the exception message.
